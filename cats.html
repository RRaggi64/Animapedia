    <h2>What is a Cat?</h2>
    <p>The domestic cat, or house cat, is a small mammal that has lived among people for thousands of years. People have kept cats as pets, used them as hunters, and even worshipped them as gods. Domestic cats belong to the same animal family as the lion, tiger, jaguar, leopard, puma, and cheetah. The scientific name of the domestic cat is <i><strong>Felis catus</strong></i>.</p>
    <h2>Habitat</h2>
    <p>Domestic cats live with people in nearly every part of the world. Some domestic cats have no home. These cats, called <i><strong>feral cats</strong></i>, wander freely in many cities.</p>
    <h2>Breeds and Physical Features</h2>
    <p>The domestic cat has a long and powerfully built body. Males are about 28 inches (71 centimeters) long. Females are about 20 inches (51 centimeters) long. Large eyes help the cat to see well at night. Its triangular ears can turn quickly toward the source of a sound. Four rows of stiff whiskers grow on each side of the nose. These give the cat a delicate sense of touch. A catâ€™s fur may be black, white, brown, gray, yellow, red, or orange. It may also be striped (tabby); a mixture of white, black, and yellow (tortoiseshell); or marked with patches of color (calico). Cats use their rough tongues to comb and to clean their fur. There are many breeds of domestic cat. Cats of the same breed have a similar length of hair and other similar features. Most breedsâ€”for example, the Abyssinian, the American Shorthair, and the Siameseâ€”have short hair. Other breeds, including the Persian, have long, thick coats.</p>

    <h2>Behavior</h2>
    <p>Domestic cats are carnivores, or meat-eaters. Many hunt and eat small animals, including birds, mice, and rabbits. They use their claws, which they can draw back or in, and their strong, sharp teeth to catch prey. House cats eat mainly canned or dry food made especially for cats. The cat is the only animal that makes a sound called a purr. Cats produce purring in their throat. No one knows exactly why cats purr, but it may be a sign of comfort. Cats also make other sounds, including meowing, hissing, yowling, and growling.</p>

    <h2>Life Cycle</h2>
    <p>A female cat gives birth to a litter of kittens about two months after mating. A female may have two to three litters a year. The average litter is four kittens, but there may be only one kitten or as many as seven. A newborn kitten is about 3 inches (8 centimeters) long. It has no teeth, the ears lie flat, and the eyes are closed. A kittenâ€™s full development takes about one year. Cats may live to be about 15 years old.</p>
    <h2>Human Relationship</h2>
    <p>About 4,500 years ago the ancient Egyptians worshipped cats. The Egyptians probably domesticated, or tamed, wild cats about 3,500 years ago. They used these cats to kill the rats and mice that ate their stored grain. During the Middle Ages (about ad 500â€“1500), many Europeans feared cats because cats were linked with witches. Some people still think that black cats are unlucky. Today millions of people around the world keep cats as pets. In the United States there are more pet cats than pet dogs.</p>
